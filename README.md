# lc-house-alarm

Leaving Cert project.
Created a house alarm system using a Microbit, coded in Python and Javascript in order to connect to a Firebase Database.

Warning - website log-in no longer works as the database on Firebase has been removed due to inactivity. I will attach a video of the working 


Description of system:
- basic first website with details on product and a log-in account system
- system was used for the user to be notified about an alarm going off (aka a door or window opening)
- microbit was programmed to react to magnetic changes which alerted a python program
- python program accessed the database and updated the alarm activity
- database contacted and updated the website
